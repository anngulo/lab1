</p><p>
</p><p><b>Question 1. GAUGE: What the signal strength indicator shows, how is it measured and for what the result is used in mobile communication?<b></b></b></p>
<p>
The signal strength indicator shows how good the connection between the base station and this mobile phone.
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Question 2. GAUGE: Which range of signal strength values is considered good, which is satisfactory and below which is not measured?<b></b></b></p>
<p>
good: starting from -98 and more
</p><p>
satisfactory: from -108 dB to -99 dB
</p><p>
below which is not measured: less than -118 dB
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Question 3. GAUGE: What other information can I get from this measurement window (1-2 sentences)?<b></b></b></p>
<p>
you can find out what type of network and which service provider is currently being used.
</p><p>
</p><h3>2.3 RAW</h3>
<p>ADD screenshots of RAW tab.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p><b>Question 1. RAW: How many neighboring base stations are being measured?
<b></b></b></p><p>
2 neighboring base stations
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Question 2. RAW: What technical information is collected on the serving base station, what is collected on the neighboring base stations? Find possible differences between used mobile technologies.<b>
</b></b></p><p>
the serving base station's technical information: MCC, MNC, TAC, ECI, eNB, RSRP, RSRQ, LCID, ASU, Power
</p><p>
</p><p>
the neighboring base stations technical information: RSCP , ASU , PSC , Power
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Question 3. RAW: Find out what each displayed number means, explain in the report.<b></b></b></p>
<p>
MCC - Mobile Country Code to identify the country which a mobile phone belongs to
</p><p>
</p><p>
MNC - Mobile Network Code to identify a mobile phone's network
</p><p>
</p><p>
TAC - Tracking Area Code to identify a tracking area in a particular network
</p><p>
</p><p>
ECI - E-UTRAN Cell Identifier to identify cells globally
</p><p>
</p><p>
PCI - Physical Cell ID to indicate the physical layer identity of the cell
</p><p>
</p><p>
LCID - Local Cell Identifier
</p><p>
</p><p>
NID - Network ID 
</p><p>
</p><p>
ASU - Arbitrary Strength Unit is an integer value that is proportional to the received signal strength
</p><p>
</p><p>
RSRQ - Reference Signal Received Quality to indicate the quality of the received reference signal
</p><p>
</p><p>
RSSNR - Reference Signal Signal to Noise Ratio is the ratio of signal power to the noise power
</p><p>
</p><p>
CQI - Channel Quality Indicator is an indicator which shows how good or bad the communication channel quality is
</p><p>
</p><p>
TA - Timing Advance allows to control the signal delays between the Mobile Station (MS) and Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
</p><p>
</p><p>
RSRP - Reference Signal Received Power shows the average power of the received pilot signals or the level of the received signal from the Base Station.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Power shows signal power in watts
</p><p>
</p><p>
Band shows frequency spectrum
</p><p>
</p><h3>2.4 MAP Measurement point.</h3>
