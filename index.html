<p>
<p>Question 1. GAUGE: What the signal strength indicator shows, how is it measured and for what the result is used in mobile communication? </p>
<p>
The signal strength indicator shows how good the connection between the base station and this mobile phone.
<p>
<p>Question 2. GAUGE: Which range of signal strength values is considered good, which is satisfactory and below which is not measured? </p>
<p>
good: starting from -98 and more
<p>
satisfactory: from -108 dB to -99 dB
<p>
below which is not measured: less than -118 dB
<p>
<p>Question 3. GAUGE: What other information can I get from this measurement window (1-2 sentences)? </p>
<p>
you can find out what type of network, which service provider is currently being used.
